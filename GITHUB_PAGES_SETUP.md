# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

Your repository is ready! Follow these steps to deploy your website to GitHub Pages:

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/emiliancristea/party-scan
2. Click on **Settings** tab (at the top right of the repository)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- This usually takes 2-10 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

## Step 3: Access Your Website
Your website will be available at:
**https://emiliancristea.github.io/party-scan/**

## Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. In the Pages settings, add your custom domain
2. Update your domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure your main file is named `index.html` (âœ… you already have this)
- Ensure your repository is public (private repos need GitHub Pro for Pages)
- Check the Actions tab for any build errors

## Future Updates
To update your website:
1. Make changes to your files
2. Commit and push to the main branch
3. GitHub Pages will automatically update your live site
